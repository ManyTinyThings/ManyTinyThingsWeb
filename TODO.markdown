# TODO    

* Bugs
    * Some weirdness with timesteps when it lags
* Run backwards
    * Might have to arrange fixed timestep for this to work
* Controls
    * Move particles around
    * Control velocities
    * Draggable borders of box
* More than one kind of particle
    * Different colors
* Measurements
    * Measure entropy
    * Measure temperature
    * Pressure should be measured over time, not timesteps
* Figures
    * Graph over quantities
    * Show total momentum as vector
* Optimizations
    * Quadtree for collisions http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-use-quadtrees-to-detect-likely-collisions-in-2d-space--gamedev-374
