# Dynamic Thermodynamics
#### A study in static

Thermodynamics is the study of heat. What is heat? That's like temperature, right? Hot and cold and so on. And thermodynamics has something to do with entropy, whatever that is (disorder something something). You might also have heard something about energy loss becoming heat somehow. All this is actually pretty easy if you look at it right. Let's take a closer look, literally.


## Main explanations

* What is heat/energy?
  * Billiard balls
  * Lots of billiard balls
* What is temperature?
  * Inverse popularity?
* What is pressure?
  * Relation to volume (piston?)
  * Smattering sound
  * Negative pressure (e.g. a jar)
  * Gravity -> air pressure
* What is entropy?
  * Color mixing
  * Warm/cold mixing
  * Egg breaking?
* Arrow of time
  * Messy initially -> run forwards and backwards
  * Divided (ordered) initially  -> run forwards and backwards
* Brownian motion
    * Draw trajectory of one particle
* Friction
    * Bigger ball collides into sea of small balls


#### Small ideas


We see that Energy is conserved, which should be true for elastic collisions. [Is momentum conserved? Why/why not?]
