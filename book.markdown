# Dynamic Thermodynamics
#### A study in static

Thermodynamics is the study of heat. What is heat? That's like temperature, right? Hot and cold and so on. And thermodynamics has something to do with entropy, whatever that is (disorder something something). You might also have heard something about energy loss becoming heat somehow. All this is actually pretty easy if you look at it right. Let's take a closer look, literally.





We see that Energy is conserved, which should be true for elastic collisions. [Is momentum conserved? Why/why not?]
