# Many Tiny Things

We live in a _huge_ world made up of _tiny_ parts.

Galaxies, stars, planets, continents, cities, people, cells, molecules, atoms, protons, quarks.

Most of the time, we don't think about this, and live our lives in the middle of the large and small. We care about the things we can see and touch, and rightly so: that's what is most important at the scale where we live. Let's call things we can see with our naked eyes _macroscopic_.

The _microscopic_, things we _can't_ see unless we use a _microscope_, is not as common in everyday life. It does come up, for instance, when talking about nutrition: we can't see the fat, carbohydrates and vitamins in food. 

This book/essay/series of explanations is about how the _microscopic_ connects to the _macroscopic_. We will use our intuition from everyday, macroscopic life to understand what's happening at the level of atoms, and then see how looking at _many tiny things_ can help us understand things that happen in everyday life.

## So, what kinda book is this?

It's sort of like a textbook, but with more pictures than usual. And the pictures are moving. And you can interact with the pictures and they will respond! So basically, it's a Harry Potter physics comic book.

If that sounded nonsensical, don't worry, we'll just jump right in! (The whole point of being interactive is that instead of just me telling you, you can explore yourself!)

Here's a typical picture:

<script>
    createSimulation({
        controls: [],
        parameters: {
            particleCount: 1,
            radiusScaling: 0.08,
            bondEnergy: 0,
            maxInitialSpeed: 0,
        },
    });
</script>
